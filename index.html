        <img class="who-am-i-photo" src="assets/madhu_potrait.jpg"/>

        <p>
        I am Madhu, a queer, cis, brown, Tamil woman living in Toronto, Canada.  I have been working as a manager of people at technology companies for the past few years, building collaborative, kind and resilient teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            I received my coaching education from the <a title="Link to Academy of Creative Coaching" href="https://academyofcreativecoaching.com/about/">Academy of Creative Coaching</a>, which is accredited by the <a href="coachingfederation.org" title="Link to ICF website">Internation Coaching Federation (ICF)</a>. I've completed my training at the Associate Certified Coach (ACC) level, receiving training at the Professional Certified Coach (PCC) level and I'm working towards my <a title="Link to ICF Credentialing page" href=
                                                         https://coachingfederation.org/credentials-and-standards
                                                         >ICF credentials</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        I love to read, listen to podcasts, and I'm currently learning to sew and draw. I am inspired by queer artists of color that seek to end oppression through their radical work, especially <a href="http://adriennemareebrown.net/" title="adriennemareebrown's website">adriennemareebrown</a>, whose books Pleasure Activism and Emergent Strategy influence all my work.
        </p>
        <p>
        I envision a world where all humans, especially those of us that are queer, fat, disabled or marginalized in any way have endless access to fulfillment and pleasure. I humbly offer this coaching practice as my contribution to this future.

        <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
        <h3>
          What is your coaching approach?
        </h3>

        <p>
        Coaching is not therapy, consulting or advice. As a coach, I act as a facilitator and a mirror, listening deeply, asking powerful questions, and offering insights. I believe that you, my client, holds all the answers.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the introductory call and first session, we will work to understand your overall needs from coaching, and decide on a schedule and high level goals. In every following coaching session, we will dive into your topic of focus and come up with next actions and commitments.
        </p>
        <p>
        Some example reasons to seek coaching are:

        <ul>
          <li>Navigating blocks or burnout in your creative or leadership practice</li>
          <li>Finding paths to move forward when feeling lost in pursuing a big dream or goal</li>
          <li>Needing support in going from surviving to thriving as you recover from trauma through healing</li>
          <li>Seeking solutions and strategies when you face challenges or conflicts in your life, relationship or practice</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        As a queer person and a survivor of trauma, I take a lot of care in continually educating myself to operate within a trauma-informed, anti-oppressive, intersectional and fat-positive framework. I extend care in my coaching to your whole intrinsically worthy self - identities, strengths and struggles included.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How is coaching different from therapy/counselling?
        </h3>
        <p>
        Therapy and coaching practices share techniques like listening, asking questions, observing patterns of behavior, and identifying limiting beliefs. However the focus, goals and scope of the two differ significantly.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Coaching focuses on present behavior and seeks to modify them or introduce new behaviors to move towards your goals. Therapy on the other hand may involve analyzing your past to understand why present behaviors occur. This difference can also be understood broadly as coaching focuses on "how" to move towards a goal, whereas therapy focuses more on "why" some behavioral patterns occur.
          </li>
          <li>
            Coaching goals are often action-oriented and outcome-focused, whereas therapy goals may be improved mental health, gaining deeper understanding of your behavior and thought patterns, building your sense of self, processing grief or trauma.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlike therapists, coaches cannot diagnose or treat mental health challenges.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are a couple examples from my personal life to illustrate this further:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When I go through depressive periods, I talk to my therapist to understand why I'm affected in this way. In coaching, I may talk about how I can manage my work, improve my support system, build some nurturing practices into my schedule, so I can have a plan in place when I'm depressed.
          </li>
          <li>
            In therapy, I talk about the formative reasons for my perfectionism and often find new reasons and perspectives to be kinder to myself. In coaching, I work on identifying project management strategies that help me manage my tendency for perfectionism.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Is this coaching accessible to me?
        </h3>
        <p>
        If my per session rate (130 CAD) is not accessible to you for any reason, I currently offer a number of choose-what-you-pay sliding scale spots at 40-80 CAD/per session for up to 6 sessions.
        </p>

        <p>
        My coaching is offerred over phone or video (through Zoom), and an internet or phone connection is needed to access it. My primary language is English, but I can also understand and speak Tamil and some Hindi.
        </p>

        <p>
        I can accept clients in Canada and internationally, and accept payments through Interac (Canada only), or credit cards (through Stripe).
        </p>
        <p>
        Please <a href="mailto:hello@kolamcoaching.com">email</a> me if your accessibility need is not met by the above, and you would like to work with me, describing your needs. I will do my best to find a path to meeting them.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What is Kolam?
        </h3>
        <p>
        Kolam is an art form originating from Tamil culture. Primarily practiced by women, it involves creating gorgeous fractal art construed from interweaving basic lines and dots. Traditionally, they are created using rice flour, outside the front door early every morning. Over the day, ants feed on the Kolam, and it slowly disintegrates, inviting more Kolam for the next morning. Kolam represents for me a connection to the land I'm from, and my values of simplicity, creativity, presence, and repetitive practice that holds inherent value while eschewing all capitalistic gain.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What are your ethics?
        </h3>
        <p>
        As an International Coach Federation (ICF) coach in training, I am bound by the <a href="ttps://coachingfederation.org/code-of-ethics">ICF’s Code of Ethics</a>. This code will apply to myself and any support personnel or firms I work with in the administration of my business. To supplement the ICF’s Code of Ethics, I also agree to abide by the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Any support personnel I employ for my business will be paid fairly pertaining to their profession and rates set by them, and at the minimum will be compensated living wages for their region.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am bound by the <a href="http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/guide-your-rights-and-responsibilities-under-human-rights-code/part-i-%E2%80%93-freedom-discrimination">Ontario Human Rights Commissions’ Human Right Code</a>, which protects people from discrimination under certain classes. While not listed under the Code, my business ethics will not tolerate any discrimination based on illness, trauma history or body size. I will strive to build an inclusive business where my clients can experience a strong sense of safety and belonging, where their whole self is welcome to be present and to thrive.
          </li>
          <li>
            I commit to continuous learning and education in order to be up to date on ICF’s standards and ethics, best practices in coaching, and inclusive language practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            I commit to taking feedback on my coaching practice from my clients in a serious and non-defensive manner, and work on improving my skills and technique in order to provide the best possible coaching service to my clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            If in the course of our coaching sessions, we uncover information that leads us to conclude that the needs of the client will be better served by a different professional such as another coach, therapist or other mental health professional, I will seek to amend, renegotiate or cancel our coaching agreement, and refer or recommend seeking relevant support.
          </li>
        </ul>
